# Rock, Paper, Scissors AI Trainer

This repository contains the code for a web-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game with an AI opponent. The goal is to train the AI to exploit human tendencies and eventually become the best RPS player in the world.

## How to Play

Go to https://autumnchiu.com/rock-paper-scissors-ai and take it from there. I trust you to figure it out.

## How It Works

todo: write this when you actually understand it

## Technologies Used

* **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, and raw and uncut JavaScript.
* (Future) Back-end: will probably be an AWS Lambda plus some database.

## Build Instructions

(todo: use big girl words)

we got a python venv (venv should be built in w python)

```bash
cd lambda/
source rps_ai/bin/activate
pip-compile requirements.in # optional; only needed if you've changed the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
